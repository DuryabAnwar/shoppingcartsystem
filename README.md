# shoppingcartsystem
This project report presents the development of an Online Shopping Cart System
implemented in C++. The system simulates a simple shopping cart where users can
log in, browse items by categories, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.
Key features include item management, category handling, cart functionalities, undo
operations, and a checkout process. The system utilizes a linked list for managing
items and leverages stacks and queues for additional functionalities like undoing
actions and managing a checkout queue.
